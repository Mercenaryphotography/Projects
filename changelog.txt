Starting a change log for ye olde github

Changed the weapon select to also set the players class and starting stats.

Change magic in the combat menu to ability, added Warrior Lifesteal attack

Sleep Timer

playerstate source was created to keep the code clean, Ideally I only want the main engine loop to exist in scarletdaughter.sh and most other functions being offloaded into sourced txt files.

added conditions to both the discover Mountains event and the gain strength event on the plains
need to try to see if I can make weighted choices for odds of going to a random location. Probably ranges, if number is 1-8 do A if 9-17 do B, etc...

added the warriors lifesteal attack, and it works. Still need to refine the combat system.

made the world map source and made a folder for all the source files to live in, no extra explore options made but mountains is next.

added 5 more locations to Plains for variety, a one time luck increase and a lore piece. Need to rework the base menu to be a more in the Capital city.

added some story flags for later progression calls.

=============================================

Fixed the coward function and run away in combat

cleaned up some of the comments

fixed up World and Playerstate, switched true and false flags to boolean 0 and 1 flags instead for simplicity

added mountain events, need to still make more combats. possibly make a simple enemy logic loop for some random aspects to battle.

fixed spacing issues with some prompts

Created a basic Save and Load Function and Delete added to the Sources dir.

figured out how to make choices case sensistive so that makes things easier in case strings

modified combat to pull randomly from a pool

=============================================
fixed broken combat for special ability now that the damage is an array range instead of a min and max
reflowed the combat loop to check for monster health before it gets to attack
moved the monster animations to their own source file called masset.txt in the Sources directory
level up system added, haven't tested it for balancing yet. will probably need to be tweaked a lot.
got rid of Monsterstate.txt source. Will just keep the pools in the combat source instead.
fixed explore function for defaulting, if it hits a bad seed number then it will default to battle while the count is still active.
made a quick track to end game, want to test scaling so I know where the Witch should be at for the final boss fight.
started creating the menus for each classes ability options. by level 20 each non mage will have 3 abilities and the mage will have 5 spells
