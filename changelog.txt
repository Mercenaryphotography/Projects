Starting a change log for ye olde github

Changed the weapon select to also set the players class and starting stats.

Change magic in the combat menu to ability, added Warrior Lifesteal attack

Sleep Timer

playerstate source was created to keep the code clean, Ideally I only want the main engine loop to exist in scarletdaughter.sh and most other functions being offloaded into sourced txt files.

added conditions to both the discover Mountains event and the gain strength event on the plains
need to try to see if I can make weighted choices for odds of going to a random location. Probably ranges, if number is 1-8 do A if 9-17 do B, etc...

added the warriors lifesteal attack, and it works. Still need to refine the combat system.
